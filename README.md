# OnlyLearn
An open-source platform for learning Web Development for free with over 60 lessons in HTML5, CSS3, Responsive Design.
This project was finished on December 2020 and started to test my knowledge on React and to help people learn information for free, it has a simple UI/UX, you have to be logged in to start learning and you can learn what lesson you want at any time and you have a text-editor where you can test your knowledge with a fast in browser result of your code.

# Technology
I used mainly React JS for the code with React Hooks, React Router and other dependencies such as AOS for animations, CodeMirror for the text editor and Firebase for authentication. Good to know that your code from the text-editor will be saved in your local storage.

# Journey
This application is now on stand-by (Beta version) until new ideas and interest appear, I am willing to host the application with a custom domain in the future and give to people the opportunity to learn information for free. The website is hosted for preview at: https://only-learn-3ff6b.web.app/, but you can learn from there even if is in beta and maybe will appear bugs.

# Contributions
I am available to opportunities, if you have an idea or you want to contribute to this application, please be free to make a pull-request or contact me on: tudorbussines77@gmail.com or on my website at: https://tudorale.github.io/portfolio/ and I will reach you out. Also if you have a team of developers and you have a same idea or a same project and you are interested to "buy" the application I am free to help you out.
