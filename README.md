# OnlyLearn

## Description
An open-source platform for learning Web Development for free with over 60 lessons in HTML5, CSS3, Responsive Design.
This project was finished on December 2020 and started to test my knowledge on React and to help people learn information for free, it has a simple UI/UX, you have to be logged in to start learning and you can learn what lesson you want at any time and you have a text-editor where you can test your knowledge with a fast in browser result of your code.

## Features
1. Free Learning: Access to a wide range of lessons in HTML5, CSS3, and Responsive Design without any cost or subscription fees.
2. User-Friendly Interface: Enjoy a simple and intuitive user interface that makes learning easy and efficient.
3. Interactive Text Editor: Practice your coding skills in a text editor that provides fast in-browser support for your code.
4. Beginner Friendly: No web development experience? No problem. With over 60 lessons, OnlyLearn provdes structured lessons to make it easy to get started and gradually build your skills.
    
## Technology
I used mainly React JS for the code with React Hooks, React Router and other dependencies such as AOS for animations, CodeMirror for the text editor and Firebase for authentication. Good to know that your code from the text-editor will be saved in your local storage.

5. Set up Firebase Authentication:
- Visit the Firebase Console at https://console.firebase.google.com/
- Create a new Firebase project
- Obtain the Firebase configuration found in project settinfs
- In your project directory, create a file named '.env.local' to store your Firebase configuration as environment variables. 

6. Start the local server by running the following command:
    npm run start

7. Access the application by opening a web browser and go to http://localhost:3000/

## Journey
This application is now on stand-by (Beta version) until new ideas and interest appear, I am willing to host the application with a custom domain in the future and give to people the opportunity to learn information for free. The website is hosted for preview at: https://only-learn-3ff6b.web.app/, but you can learn from there even if is in beta and maybe will appear bugs.
